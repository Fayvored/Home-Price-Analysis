The Brazilian real estate market offers an intriguing mix of affordability, diversity, and regional uniqueness. With the increasing demand for data-driven decisions in real estate, I recently analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that provided detailed information on property listings across Brazil.

The dataset consisted of two CSV files — brasil-real-estate-1.csv and brasil-real-estate-2.csv. The first file contained 12,834 rows and 6 columns, while the second had 12,833 rows and 7 columns. Although the formats varied slightly, both datasets shared key features like price, area, and location, which made them suitable for a unified analysis after cleaning.

This project gave me hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory visualization using Python, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The Brazilian real estate market, like many others, is a rich ground for data storytelling — from price dynamics to regional trends and size distribution.

Understanding the structure of such datasets, cleaning them efficiently, and extracting insights through visualization are critical steps in building data-driven real estate tools. Whether you’re a data scientist, real estate analyst, or curious buyer, these techniques can empower smarter decisions in property markets around the world.
